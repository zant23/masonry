A small Image Gallery Template for Flutter.


<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project uses Flutter to implement an Image Gallery which displays the local Photos on the device. The architecture is inspired by a Clean Architecture layout presented in the book from Robert C. Martin. To access and display the images on the device, the following packages were used:
* [Photo Manager](https://pub.dev/packages/photo_manager)
* [Photo View](https://pub.dev/packages/photo_view)
* [Waterfall Flow](https://pub.dev/packages/waterfall_flow)

Additionally as a State Management solution [Hooks Riverpod](https://pub.dev/packages/hooks_riverpod) was used.
